HR Analytics Dashboard
Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard designed to provide insights into employee data, with a specific focus on understanding and visualizing employee attrition. The dashboard leverages key HR metrics to help identify trends, patterns, and potential root causes of turnover, enabling data-driven decision-making for talent management and retention strategies.

The analysis and visualizations were created using Python for data processing and a Business Intelligence tool (e.g., Power BI or Tableau) for the final dashboard creation.

Key Features of the Dashboard
Employee Snapshot: Quick overview of key company-wide metrics including total employee count, attrition numbers, and the overall attrition rate.

Demographic Analysis: Breakdown of average employee age, average salary, and average years of service.

Detailed Attrition Breakdown: The core of the dashboard, providing granular insights into attrition based on:

Education: Identifying which educational backgrounds have the highest turnover.

Salary: Uncovering if compensation is a significant factor in employees leaving.

Age: Pinpointing the age demographics most affected by attrition.

Gender: Highlighting any gender-based differences in turnover rates.

Job Role: Identifying specific job titles with the highest attrition numbers.

Tenure (Years): Revealing at what stage of their career with the company employees are most likely to leave.

Technologies Used
Data Analysis & Processing: Python

pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

numpy: For numerical operations.

Data Visualization & Dashboarding: Power BI / Tableau (or a similar BI tool)

Version Control: Git & GitHub

SuperStore Sales Dashboard
Project Overview
This project features an interactive SuperStore Sales Dashboard, built to analyze and visualize sales performance metrics. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales data across different dimensions, helping to identify trends, understand customer behavior, and evaluate profitability. It is a powerful tool for business users to gain actionable insights at a glance.

The analysis and visualizations were created using a Business Intelligence tool (e.g., Power BI or Tableau) and are based on the popular SuperStore sample dataset.

Key Features of the Dashboard
Executive Summary: A high-level view of key performance indicators (KPIs) including total orders, total sales, total profit, and average shipping time.

Geographic Analysis: An interactive map showing sales and profit distribution across different states, allowing for quick identification of top-performing and underperforming regions.

Sales Breakdown: Detailed visualizations breaking down sales by:

Payment Mode: Understanding the distribution of sales across different payment methods (Cards, COD, Online).

Region: Analyzing sales performance across the four main regions (Central, East, South, West).

Customer Segment: Insights into which customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) generate the most sales.

Ship Mode: Evaluating the efficiency and revenue contribution of different shipping methods (Standard, Second, First, Same Day).

Time-Series Analysis: Line charts for tracking sales and profit trends over time, with a comparison between different years (2019 and 2020). This helps in identifying seasonality and year-over-year growth.

Category and Sub-Category Performance: Bar charts highlighting the performance of different product categories and sub-categories, allowing for focused analysis on specific product lines.

Interactive Filters: The dashboard includes filters for Department and Region in the top right, allowing users to drill down into specific areas of interest.

Technologies Used
Data Analysis & Processing: Python (e.g., pandas) - for initial data cleaning if needed.

Data Visualization & Dashboarding: Power BI / Tableau (or a similar BI tool).

Version Control: Git & GitHub.


Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard
Project Overview
This project presents a Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard, an interactive tool designed to visualize and analyze patient data to understand factors related to heart failure survival. The dashboard provides key insights into survival rates, demographics, and the impact of various medical conditions and lifestyle factors on patient outcomes. The primary goal is to transform complex medical data into easily digestible visuals that can aid in risk assessment and provide a foundation for further research.

The dashboard was developed using a Business Intelligence tool (e.g., Power BI or Tableau) and is based on a public dataset containing medical records of heart failure patients.

Key Features of the Dashboard
Survival Metrics: A clear summary of the overall Survival Rate, Average Age of Survival, Total Survivors, and Total Deaths.

Demographic Breakdown: Visuals showing survival outcomes broken down by gender, with a comparison between male and female patients.

Survival by Medical Indicators: Detailed bar charts that correlate survival count with key medical metrics:

Ejection Fraction: The percentage of blood leaving the heart with each contraction, analyzed by age group.

Serum Creatinine: A waste product in the blood, indicating kidney function, also analyzed by age group.

Risk Factor Impact: A stacked chart illustrating the combined impact of smoking, high blood pressure, anemia, and diabetes on survival across different age groups. This helps identify high-risk patient profiles.

Survival Rate by Age Group: A line chart showing how the survival rate changes across different age groups, clearly highlighting which age demographics have the highest and lowest survival rates.

User Filters: A set of filters on the left panel allows users to drill down the data based on specific criteria for a more detailed analysis.

Technologies Used
Data Analysis & Processing: Python (e.g., pandas) - for initial data cleaning and preparation.

Data Visualization & Dashboarding: Power BI / Tableau (or a similar BI tool).

Version Control: Git & GitHub.
